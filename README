ABOUT

httptunnel creates a bidirectional virtual data path tunnelled in HTTP  
requests.  The requests can be sent via an HTTP proxy if so desired.  

This can be useful for users behind restrictive firewalls.  If WWW  
access is allowed through an HTTP proxy, it's possible to use  
httptunnel and, say, telnet or PPP to connect to a computer outside  
the firewall.  

If you still don't understand what this is all about, maybe you  
can find some useful information in the FAQ file.  

This program is mostly intended for technically-oriented users.  
They should know what to do.  

INSTALL
  
Read INSTALL for instructions on how to build a released version.  
If you build the development repository, run `./autogen.sh` first.

I take no responsibility for what you do with this software.  It has  
the potential to do dangerous things, like disabling the protection  
you system administrator has set up for the local network.  Read the  
DISCLAIMER file.  

USAGE & DOCUMENTATION
 
There are two programs: `hts` and `htc`.  `hts` is the *httptunnel server*  
and `htc` is the *client*.  `hts` should be installed on a computer outside  
the HTTP proxy, and `htc` should be installed on your local computer.  

Documentation about how to use the programs should be searched in this  
order:  
 1. source code  
 2. --help output  
 3. FAQ  
 4. README  

Having said that, here's a (possibly outdated) example:  
 * start httptunnel server:  
  * At host REMOTE, start `hts` like this:  
    `hts -F localhost:23 8888` (set up httptunnel server to listen on port 8888 and forward to localhost:23)   
 * start httptunnel client:  
   * At host LOCAL, start `htc` like this:  
    `htc -F 2323 -P PROXY_ADDRESS:8000 REMOTE_IP:8888` (set up httptunnel client to forward localhost:2323 to REMOTE_IP:8888 via a local proxy at PROXY_ADDRESS:8000) 
  * or, if using a buffering HTTP proxy:  
    `htc -F 2323 -P PROXY_ADDRESS:8000 -B 48K REMOTE_IP:8888`  
  * Now you can do this at host LOCAL:  
    `telnet localhost 2323` (telnet in to REMOTE_IP:8888 via your httptunnel you just configured above on port localhost:2323)  
    ...and you will hopefully get a login prompt from host REMOTE_IP.
